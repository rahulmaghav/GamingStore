   <h2>Who We Are</h2>
   <p>GamingX is an online store dedicated to gaming and gamers in India. We created
     GamingXin with the aim to allow Indian gamers do just what the name says i.e. Simply Play More and Play Bold. With a massive
     collection of new and pre-owned games, we at GamingX are determined to create a destination where you can get
     the games of your choice, whenever you want them.</p> 
    
   <h2>Who We Are NOT</h2>
   <p>We are not a video game rental service. We do not provide  games on rent. We neither support nor 
      deal in pirated games and modded consoles. All games sold at GamingX are original and guaranteed to be working 
      perfectly.</p>

   <p> We focus on pre-owned games market to promote the culture of console gaming in
      India and make it a more lucrative market for both domestic and international developers/publishers.</p>    


   <h2>Our Mission</h2>
   <p> GamingX mission is to promote the culture of
      gaming in India, for we believe it is the highest form of entertainment!! We have taken it upon ourselves to get you 
      back to your consoles.</p>

   <p>Many of us move away from gaming with age either because we couldn’t find the time in our busy schedules for some fun
      or the associated costs seem too much for the time that we can actually devote to gaming. At GamingX, we don’t 
      believe that’s a good enough reason to give up on gaming and those countless hours of fun. By allowing you to buy as 
      well as sell pre-owned games easily on our online store, we help you significant cut down on your gaming costs, 
      making gaming a more welcome proposition. :)</p>
